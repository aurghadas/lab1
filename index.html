  <h1>Writing Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>● Software development process is the process of creating a computer 
software product. There are few steps of software development. Those 
are: 1. Planning, 2. Implementation, 3. Testing and 4. Deployment and 
Maintenance.
Planning: Requirement gathering is one of the most important parts in 
planning. Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, 
an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and 
clearly stated. Planning is the first step of this process.
Implementation: Usually, Software Engineers write code in this step.
Testing: Testing is the process in which we can ensure that if the 
software is ready to run or not . We can identify problems through this 
process. If we find any problem in this step then we can fix it and go to 
the next step. Otherwise, we can just move forward after ensuring that 
everything is ok.
Deployment and Maintenance: After testing successfully, getting 
approval for release, sold the software on market, the deployment 
starts. Only releasing a software is not the end of this process. It needs 
continuous update to cope up with the present world.
</p>
  <p> ● In my view, design is one of the most significant things before 
doing something actually. For example : Architecture Engineers 
make plan / design for the building and according to that plan /
design Civil Engineers fabricate the building on field. In the 
Software Engineering field, we are both Architecture and Civil 
Engineers of Software. In order to elevate our success rate 
,design is an eminent part of our process. Without making any 
design for software ,if we start working on it then there is a higher 
chance to fail in that project .So, the software design is so 
important in the field of Software Engineering.</p>

  <p> ● Facebook is one of the applications that I personally use and 
think that it is well designed. Because, the interface of this app is 
so captivating. Moreover, it is a great way to get connected with 
people all around the world. When someone enter into the app 
,most of the important things are present in the front page .So, it 
becomes convenient for users to use this app. This application 
wasn’t like this when it got released. Day by day, with
improvisation it’s becoming better and better.</p>
  
  <h1>Writing Assignment 2</h1>
  
  <p>Answer to the Question Number 1:</p>
  <p>Require gathering means collecting a set of operations that the 
software must perform. The best way to do it is by communicating 
with clients. This is the most significant part of this process. We 
should ask the client questions using “What “or that type of 
questions which provide substantial information rather than only 
yes/no. Without asking questions we won’t be able to clear about 
what they want us to build. So, it’s better to ask them all possible 
questions in spite of assuming things by our own. Asking 
questions and converting their answer as requirement is also one 
of the important tasks in this process. Moreover, observation is 
also a way to gather requirements. We can send any person to 
client’s territory to observe that what server they are using and
what they actually need on their software.</p>
  <p>In the software development process, requirement gathering is 
really essential because without this we won’t be able to 
understand that what we have to do on our software product and 
how to mitigate the needs of client’s. Without the requirement 
gathering step there is a high chance to make mess in the 
process and being unable to satisfy the clients.
</p>
  
  <p>Answer to the Question Number 2:</p>

  <p>The software product I talked about in writing assignment 1 
was Facebook. Now, I’m going to write 5 user stories for that 
software below:</p>
  
  <p>1. As a user, I want to see dislike button on Facebook so that 
I can manifest my honest reaction to anyone’s post.
2. As a user, I want to upload picture without losing its 
quality so that I can present the picture as I want.
3. As a user I want Facebook to stop gathering my 
information from other platforms and suggesting things 
using that information so that my privacy keep secure.
4. As a user I want to reach my post to everyone without 
paid boosting so that people from all around the world can 
see it.
5. As a user I want Facebook to consume less mobile date so 
that everybody can access it effortlessly.

  <h1>Writing Assignment 3</h1>

  <p>● Emotion, Culture & Context are three basic elements of empathy. 
Emotion symbolizes understanding the customers the way we 
understand ourselves. Culture symbolizes the area where the product 
will be delivered. Taking these contextual and cultural aspects into 
accounts. Context symbolizes issues customers face and mitigate those 
by re-designing the products.
</p>
  <p>● Sheep: In this business model people don’t get proper attention. 
People are treated like a sheep. Companies simply wanted to create 
and control consumer demand. This worked for a while, but it has 
become less and less effective over time. One of the problems is 
disrespectful of the people organizations are ostensibly trying to serve.
Homo Economicus: A distinct advantage of this model of people is 
that it tends to move organizations beyond a focus on messaging 
toward the actual aspects or features of products and services. In short, 
these businesses focus on quantity over quality.
The “Human Factor”: People are primarily goal-driven and taskoriented. People become more like robot than human here.</p>
  <p>● Sheep: This business model lacks “Emotion” of empathy because this 
model do not really think about their customers. They kind of neglect them 
but understanding customers is the significant part of emotion. Customers 
are more like ourselves.
Homo Economicus: This model lacks “Culture” of empathy because this 
model mainly focus on quantity more than quality. Culture includes 
internationalization and market demands where product will get more value 
which is missing in it.
The “Human Factor”: People are so task oriented in this model that they 
become like robot and lacks “Context”. It is really important to understand 
the needs and what change is required to develop the products from the 
user experience.</p>
  
  <h1>Writing Assignment 4</h1>

  <p>● “The Kodak Camera”, It is a magazine camera which can take 100 
picture without any loading. After the 100 pictures have been taken, 
the strip of film (which is wound on a spool) may be removed, and sent 
by mail to the factory to have the pictures finished. The system of 
capturing picture is just point the camera and press the button, which is 
moved into position just by turning the key. George Eastman
developed this camera. His slogan about this camera was “You press 
the button; we do the rest”. Eastman changed the game by putting his 
product into a larger system, one where customers sent in their film 
not only to get their photos processed and printed, but also to get new 
film loaded onto their old rolls.</p>

  <p>● A persona for a user of “The Kodak Camera” is given on the next 
page:</p>
  <p>(The picture used on the persona is downloaded from the internet randomly. I add this to make 
the persona livelier and captivating)
